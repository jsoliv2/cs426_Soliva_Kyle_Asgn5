<b>ADDED COMPONENTS FOR ASGN 5</b>

<b>Physics Constructs Used</b>
I created "Worm Malware" enemies for the birds to fly into and attack. The worms use Rigidbody to add Force in the direction of the bird player to get knocked away when the player runs into them at a high enough speed. When the worms hit the barrier of the play area, they despawn and explode out birdseed that gets scattered using Rigidbody Force and Gravity.

<b>Billboards</b>
I used 5 2D bird assets--one near each PC part spawn location to mark each area a PC part can be found in.

<b>Lights</b>
The PC Parts now emit different colored point lights so that they are easier to spot from afar.

<b>Sound</b>
I added a jumping sound for the bird player's midair wing flaps which lowers in pitch the less stamina the player has left, a confirmation sound for bringing a PC part to the nest, and a sound for when enemy worms get knocked away. Background chirps now happen at random.

<b>ASGN 2 README BELOW</b>

<b>Executive Summary</b>
In the 21st century, cute little birds create a PC in a huge forest. “PC Building for Bird Games” is a scavenger networking game, where all players are birds. They help collect computer parts to build a PC in a forest, this game is available in Windows targeted for children ages 6 to 14. 

<b>Formal Elements:</b>
Intelligent birds known as “birdbrains” find PC parts scattered around the forest. In order to build the PC, they have found a book on how to build a PC. They think to themselves, “Why build nests? We can build our own computer!”

<p>The procedure of our game is strictly limited only to the forest and players cannot leave; the forest is bounded by walls. The bird can fly; however, the bird has a stamina bar located on the top right corner of the screen. Our game is recommending 2-4 players. They have a limited amount of time to gather and find all the computer objects. The players can only hold one object at a time and must return the object back to the nest located at their spawn location. Once all the parts are returned to the nest before the time ends (with the help of each player in game), the players win. Otherwise, they lose and could restart the game.</p>

The movements of the bird consist of:

<b>Bird Movement</b>
WASD
•	W = Forward (While hopping or flying)
•	A  = Rotate Left (Only in midair)
•	S  = Back (Only while flying)
•	D = Rotate Right (Only in midair)

<b>Spacebar</b>
</br>
Press while on the ground to hop. Press again while in midair to flap your wings. Hold down while flying to fall slowly.

<b>Collecting computer parts</b>
Collide with computer part by moving towards it then return to the nest.
